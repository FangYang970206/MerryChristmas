# MerryChristmas
This repo is used to send my wishes to the girl named Chunxiao Li. This repo is inspired by [TaXueWWL](https://github.com/TaXueWWL/merryChristmas), thanks!

Before building the main.cpp, you should install the C++ package named [EasyX](https://www.easyx.cn/downloads/). The version I use is [2018-3-21](https://www.easyx.cn/down.aspx?id=9&no=0).The program is built and executed by VS2017.
